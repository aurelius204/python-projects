number guessing game - The objective of this project is to build a simple number guessing game that challenges the user to identify a randomly selected number within a specified range.The game begins by allowing the user to define a range by entering a lower and an upper bound (for example, from A to B). Once the range is set, the system randomly selects an integer that falls within this user-defined interval. The user's task is then to guess the chosen number using as few attempts as possible. The game provides feedback after each guess, helping the user refine their next guess based on whether their previous attempt was too high or too low.
Word guessing game - This program is a simple word-guessing game where the user has to guess the characters in a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts.The program provides feedback after each guess, helping the user to either complete the word or lose the game based on their guesses.
